#### Balance Update Endpoint
- **Problem**: Insufficient logging for debugging balance issues
- **Fix**: Added detailed logging to track balance changes
- **Location**: `backend/server.js` lines 150-170

#### Socket.IO Balance Handling
- **Problem**: Balance updates weren't properly synchronized between frontend and backend

#### Better Error Handling
- Token expiration detection and automatic logout
- Proper error messages for insufficient balance
- Graceful handling of network errors

#### Enhanced User Experience
- Immediate UI updates for better responsiveness

## How Balance System Works Now

### For Aviator Game (Real-time via Socket.IO):
1. User places bet → Balance deducted immediately
2. User cashes out → Balance increased with winnings
3. User loses (crashes) → Loss confirmed with backend

### For Other Games (REST API):
1. User plays game → Balance updated via `updateGameState`
2. Backend API called to sync balance
3. Local state updated for immediate UI feedback

### Balance Synchronization:
1. Periodic refresh every 30 seconds
2. Manual refresh button available
3. Automatic refresh on game events
4. Proper error handling for token expiration

## Testing

The balance system has been tested and verified to work correctly:
- ✅ Bet placement deducts balance
- ✅ Wins add to balance
- ✅ Losses are properly handled
- ✅ Real-time updates work
- ✅ Balance synchronization works

## Files Modified

### Backend:
- `backend/server.js` - Enhanced Socket.IO events and balance endpoints

### Frontend:
- `src/components/games/AviatorGame.tsx` - Fixed balance handling
- `src/pages/Casino.tsx` - Improved balance management

## Usage

1. Start the backend server: `cd backend && npm start`
2. Start the frontend: `npm run dev`
3. Login and play games - balance should update correctly
4. Use the refresh button if balance seems out of sync

The balance system is now fully functional and properly synchronized between frontend and backend.
